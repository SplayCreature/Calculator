# Calculator

I have created a calculator based on the IOS mobile calculator. I have always loved the design, so the color pallette I used is heavily inspired by them.

For this project I have demonstrated my ability to create:

1. Javascript
- I was able to write several separate functions that represent the mathematical operators, and call on them using conditionals based on what operator was used.
- I had trouble with how to get the textContent to only be replaced after an operator was clicked, and when adding the second number to the equation,
but I was able to figure it out using a conditional based on the button id.
- Lastly I was able to figure out how to store the value of each number before and after the operator was clicked, and use them in the functions
to fill in the equations.

2. Css
-I was able to create a semi looking 3D calculator through the use of flex-box, and box shadows both inline and outline.
- I tried to import a digital font that would match the common calculator font, however I was unable to successfully do so,
I will have to revisit once I learn more.

3. HTML
- I believe I was able to format everything in a way that makes it easily readable, which makes it easier
to understand the purpose of each div.
